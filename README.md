# AutoHotKey
This is a very simple Auto Hot Key script that helps speed things up by using keyboard macros.

I work in numerous locations, using various keyboards. Some macros work for all keyboards, some work for just one type.

This also includes example macros for working with Delvin RapidAccess keyboards.
